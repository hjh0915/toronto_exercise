[CLEOPATRA] I am sick and sullen.
[MARK ANTONY] I am sorry
to give breathing
to my purpose,--
[CLEOPATRA] Help me away,
dear Charmian; I shall fall:
It cannot be thus long,
the sides of nature
Will not sustain it.
[MARK ANTONY] Now,
my dearest queen,--
[CLEOPATRA] Pray you,
stand further from me.
[MARK ANTONY] What's the matter?
and you?
[CLEOPATRA] No problem.
